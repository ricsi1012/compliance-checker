Legacy IT Department Guidelines

SECTION 1: SECURITY & ACCESS (PASS)
We take security seriously.
- Passwords must be complex (10+ chars, special signs) and changed every 6 months.
- We have a documented Incident Response Plan available on the intranet.
- The Helpdesk maintains a strict log of all reported security incidents.

SECTION 2: DATA HANDLING (FAIL)
- Backups: We manually copy the database to an external hard drive once a month. (Risk: Infrequent)
- Encryption: Internal communications are unencrypted to improve network speed.
- Access Reviews: We review user accounts once a year during the annual performance review. (Requirement is quarterly!)
- Admin Logs: Admin activity is not logged to save disk space.
