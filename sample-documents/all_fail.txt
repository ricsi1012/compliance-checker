Startup Brainstorming & Quick Rules
Meeting Date: Monday

Tech Stack setup ideas:
We need to move fast, so let's skip the heavy bureaucracy for now.

- Logins: Let's just use "admin/admin" for the staging server for now so everyone can access it easily. No need for complex passwords yet, they just slow us down.
- User Access: We'll give everyone admin rights to the repo. We can clean it up next year or when we hire an HR person.
- Incidents: If the server crashes, just call Dave on his mobile. He will fix it. No need to write reports about it.
- Data stuff: I think the cloud provider does backups automatically? Not sure, haven't checked.
- Encryption: HTTP is fine for the MVP, setting up SSL certificates is a pain.
- Old data: Just keep everything forever, storage is cheap.
